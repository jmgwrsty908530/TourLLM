# Simulation and Teaching Evaluation of Cross-Border Tourism Service Dialogue Supported by Multilingual Large Model (LLM)

## Overview

This project explores the application of multilingual large language models (LLMs) in simulating and evaluating cross-border service dialogues within the context of smart tourism. It focuses on improving intelligent interaction models used in cross-border tourism scenarios, offering enhanced adaptability, accuracy, and relevance in multilingual and dynamic service environments.

## Features

- **Multilingual LLM Support**: Enables realistic and diverse simulations of cross-border service interactions.
- **Adaptive Conversation Dynamics**: Introduces Adaptive Cross-Border Tourism Dynamics Model (ACTDM) to manage real-time fluctuations and user behavior changes.
- **Hybrid Assessment Framework**: Leverages Hybrid Adaptive Policy Strategy (HAPS) to evaluate service dialogues using multiple metrics including user satisfaction, knowledge accuracy, and emotional dynamics.
- **Advanced Techniques**:
  - Real-time data fusion
  - Multimodal interaction
  - Semantic understanding
  - Digital twin integration
- **Educational Value**: Assists in training models in smart tourism-related education, improving response robustness and system stability.

## Applications

- Cross-border tourism platforms and digital travel assistants.
- Intelligent service training environments for educational purposes.
- Human-computer interaction studies related to multilingual scenarios.
- Smart city and global service robotics.

## Contributions

This work contributes both technically and educationally:
- **Technically**: Proposes a new hybrid model architecture combining ACTDM and HAPS to boost robustness and context-awareness in LLM-based dialogues.
- **Educationally**: Offers a valuable teaching tool to simulate complex service scenarios in real-time, fostering experiential learning.
